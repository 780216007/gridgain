The GridGain in-memory computing platform accelerates and scales out data-intensive applications across a distributed
computing architecture. It requires no rip-and-replace of your existing database and can be deployed on-premises, on a public or private cloud, or on a hybrid environment.

The [GridGain][GridGain-homepage] Community Edition (GCE) is a source-available in-memory computing platform built on Apache Ignite.
GCE includes the [Apache Ignite][apache-ignite-homepage] code base plus improvements and additional functionality developed by GridGain Systems
to enhance the performance and reliability of Apache Ignite. GCE is a hardened, high-performance version of Apache Ignite
for mission-critical in-memory computing applications.

GridGain can function as an in-memory data grid accelerating a relational database or Hadoop or it can be deployed as
a in-memory database with transactional persistence.  The system supports SQL and ACID transactions, can be used for
streaming analytics and machine and deep learning use cases.The system can be scaled out by adding
new nodes to the cluster to support up to petabytes of data from multiple databases with automatic data rebalancing and
redundant storage across the nodes.
