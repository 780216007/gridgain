The GridGain in-memory computing platform accelerates and scales out data-intensive applications across a distributed
computing architecture. It requires no rip-and-replace of your existing database and can be deployed on-premises, on a public or private cloud, or on a hybrid environment.

The [GridGain][GridGain-homepage] Community Edition (GCE) is a source-available in-memory computing platform built on Apache Ignite.
GCE includes the [Apache Ignite][apache-ignite-homepage] code base plus improvements and additional functionality developed by GridGain Systems
to enhance the performance and reliability of Apache Ignite. GCE is a hardened, high-performance version of Apache Ignite
for mission-critical in-memory computing applications.

The comprehensive GridGain in-memory computing solution includes an in-memory data grid, in-memory database, streaming analytics,
and a continuous learning framework. The system provides ANSI-99 SQL and ACID transaction support. The platform can function
as an in-memory data grid or it can be deployed as a memory-centric database which combines the speed of in-memory computing
with the durability of disk-based storage. The system can be scaled out by adding
new nodes to the cluster to support up to petabytes of data from multiple databases with automatic data rebalancing and
redundant storage across the nodes.
